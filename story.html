<h3>Task 1: Logging in and Signing up</h3> 

<p>
• As a user, I would like to be able to easily log in and sign up for this application to view my financial information.
The user should be able to navigate through a simple user interface which clearly states two choices of either logging in or signing up. If the option of signing up is chosen, the user is led to a simple sign up page in which the user inputs their name, email, phone number, password and credit card information, all of which is encrypted for user safety.  A verification email is then sent to the user to verify their newly created account after which the user can now view their financial information and use the service.
If the option of logging in is chosen, then the user is led to the login page which displays an email and password criteria. Once the user has entered their information they are asked if they would like to remain logged in for easy access to the account information.
</p>

• As a user, the SimplePay Application can help us manage the way we spend, where we spend and how much we spend. When a purchase is made using this app, the details of purchase is stored. With the storage of these purchase records, the user can see where and how much they spend, which in turn helps them to budget wiser.
